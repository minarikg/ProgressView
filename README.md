# ProgressView

### Why?
UIProgressView does not allow you to change it's height without workarounds or forcing it by constraints.

**Option 1:** If you prefer a short workaround you can take a look at: [CustomProgressView.swift](https://github.com/minarikg/ProgressView/blob/master/ProgressViewSample/CustomProgressView.swift)

**Option 2:** You can write your own custom ProgressView where you have full control and no surprises neither side effects later on if Apple changes its UIProgressView implementation in the future releases.
